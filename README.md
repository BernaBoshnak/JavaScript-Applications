Course includes working with `HTTP` and `REST` services, `asynchronous programming`, and `authenticating remote data`. It also covers the development of `single page applications`, which are web applications that load a single HTML page and then dynamically update the page with new data as the user interacts with the application. This can help to create a more seamless and responsive user experience.

Other topics that are covered in the course include `architecture`, `testing`, `client-side rendering`, `routing`, and `modular application development`.
